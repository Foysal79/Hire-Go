Project Structure

├── image/               # Folder containing image assets    
├── index.html           # Main HTML file    
├── script.js            # JavaScript file for interactivity    
├── style.css            # Custom CSS (if applicable)    
├── tailwind.config.js   # Tailwind CSS configuration (not used with CDN)   `

### Key Files:

*   **index.html**: The main HTML structure of the HireGo website.
    
*   **script.js**: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the website.
    
*   **style.css**: Custom styles for the site, if you wish to override Tailwind CSS.
    
*   **tailwind.config.js**: Tailwind CSS configuration file (only used if you're compiling Tailwind CSS locally, not necessary when using the CDN).
    

How to Use
----------

1.  git clone [https://github.com/your-username/hirego.gitcd hirego](https://github.com/Foysal79/Hire-Go.git)
    
2.  **Open the project**:
    
    *   You can directly open the index.html file in your browser to see the website.
        
3.  **Edit the files**:
    
    *   **index.html**: Contains the main structure of the site. You can modify the HTML content here.
        
    *   **style.css**: Customize the styles, if needed. Tailwind CSS is included via CDN, so you don't need to compile Tailwind manually.
        
    *   **script.js**: Add interactivity to the page if necessary.
        

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Tailwind CSS (Play CDN)**: Used for styling the website. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework.
    
*   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the site.
    
*   **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic features (optional).
